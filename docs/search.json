    "text": "John Bauer, 3rd year ChE PhD student, Andrews Lab\n\n\nHello! My name is John Bauer and I’m interested in building interspecies genetic circuits to reprogram bacterial consortia for bioproduction and bioremediation. I earned my Bachelors of Science in chemical engineering at University of Wisconsin-Madison and recently became a PhD student in the chemical engineering department of University of Massachusetts-Amherst. I am currently working on establishing biosensors for heavy metals in Pseudomonas putida. In the future, I will incorporate these sensors into a bacterial consortia where each strain contains portions of an interspecies genetic circuit for the bioremediation of heavy metals."

    "text": "Everyone was waiting outside the airlock when Lune finally arrived. The team barely acknowledges them once they took their place at the back of the room. They all stood with a boredom that only comes endless repetition. Maq gave them a terse nod from their position next to the airlock hatch leaning against the inside of the hull. They were all fidgeting in different ways to pass the time before the ships made contact. Lapu check the ports of the portable generator by their feet despite knowing they had just been replaced last time they made berth. Kahlu kept opening the center clasp of the heavy backpack forcing them to lean backwards against the wall. Faren was standing in front of airlock controls rhythmically tapping the sides of their thighs to the tune of a song.\nThe large metallic clang and the accompanying reverberations of the ships collision ended their boredom. Maq raised their eyebrows at Lune before uncrossing their arms and standing ready before the airlock port. Lapu and Kahlu shouldered their loads and fell into place behind Maq while Faren saw to the opening of the airlock.\nWith the docking clamps engaged, Faren began their survey of the abandoned ship’s environment. After a few moments spent tapping on the console, Faren announced “No need for masks, the air is passable. Little light on the oxygen side, but breathable.”\n“Any biologics flying around?” asked Maq. Lapu grinned back at Lune. Rolling their eyes and nodding towards Maq who still facing the hatch. Lapu mouthed “worry wort” back at Lune. After a few more taps on the console screen, Faren answered “There’s little to no organic material in the air, shouldn’t be a problem.”\n“I’d rather not take that chance.” said Maq. “Who knows how long the ship’s fans have been dormant. Everybody seal up.”\nWith everyone’s helmets in place. Maq’s voice came over the comms, “Enough dawdling, let’s go.”\nThey grasp the door handle. The dull iron latch is smooth and cold to the touch. The light from the port hole illuminates their arm and chest as they turn the latch. Gears whir, mechanisms click, and the sealed door locks disengage. They push the door open aided by the corridor’s warm air gently that blows past them. The door is ajar, but they look back down the hallway dim, warm and dusty, before pushing through into the room. All at once, the hull of the ship drops away from them. The majesty of the universe, the burning reds and yellows of stars and the purple and green of unborn stars cradled in their nebulas all laid bare before them. The sheer size of it all is awful in both definitions of the word. They cling to the wall and gape at the viewing bubble. It’s as if nothing is there, no curve of a glass wall, nor the quiet hum of a hull shield. The lack of boundaries is as inviting as it is terrifying. They feel as if they’re standing on the edge of a cliff. The floor of the viewing bubble appears to top a meter away from the door, but the room walls continue for another meter. They take a deep breath and venture forth. The first step off the dull grey metal is taken with deep hesitation. The nothingness that they stepped out on is firm and quickly dispels any fear they held with their breast. It is in this moment when the fear has left them, that they truly look at the universe. It is an intricate tableau. Distant stars dust the scene with clusters of red dwarfs burning brightly. Clouds of purple and green mix in a brilliant cosmic soup or like spirits frozen in a dance. The stars closer to the ship glitter like inlaid gems in a crown. They take another step out into the nothingness and any attachments to the rest of the group, the world they came from, and the species they belong to us severed. They float among the stars, adrift amongst the light of a thousand ancient stars. They do not feel small in this vastness, but one with a greater organism in the void."

    "text": "The grizzled old man scratched his chin. He hauls on the cord and the motor sputters to life. With a terse grunt, he kicks off the dock to set the boat free in the river. The syncopated hum of the engine grows suddenly loud as the boat gets up to speed.\nThe landscape before you is eerily still. The glassy water ahead is broken only by the prow of the boat. The grey sky tinged with the dull orange of the setting sun is reflected in its mirror. As the river narrows, the swampy shores become so dense with foliage they seem to trap all light in their depths.\nThe old man slows the boat. The river is so narrow now that reeds rasp against the hull. The way forward seems too small to continue, but once around a bend it opens broadly into a small lake. The old man’s eyes are transfixed on the shacks lit by torches on the opposite end. The boat picks up speed. Its humming once again hitting in slow waves.\nHalfway across the lake the wooded shacks come into focus. The wood is old and worn. A few shacks have remnants of paint clinging to the beams providing the only color to this otherwise greyscale scene. Even the people appear grey. They line the shores and dock silently staring at the incoming boat.\nThe boat’s engine grows loud in your ear. Why don’t they move? The boat glides up to the dock. Why don’t they speak?\nThe man at the end of the dock leans down with his torch and pulls the boat closer. Why can’t I leave?"

    "text": "The dense heat of the jungle clung to his damp skin. The circuitous path before him was crisscrossed in low hanging vines and leaves. Roots of gigantic trees interwove into a treacherous tapestry of undergrowth. Each one of his steps was carefully chosen to avoid their nooks. His eyes were so fixed on the ground that he frequently was slapped in the face by the oily undersides of gigantic leaves.\nThe sounds of the jungle had long left. Not a single bird proclaimed their presence. No lemur could be heard chattering to their compatriots. Even the incessant buzzing of insects had ceased its din. A lone spider resting amidst its web hanging from a leaf was the only sign of fauna he had seen in an hour. It was like an evacuation order had been issued to the jungle.\nSuddenly the web shook as a low basey noise sounded through the jungle. Another beat quickly followed the first. The startled spider fled its web to the safety of the alcove between the trunk and leaf above its web. Only its long legs could be seen.\nHe raised his eyes towards the path before him. The now steady beats seemed to be rumbling from ahead of him, muffled by the dense foliage. He hefted his pack and resumed his trek. The path began to straighten before him. Where gnarled tree trunks blocked his view, now there was broken granite stones leading up an incline fenced in by trees that had grown so densely that their trunks had fused together to form walls of twisting vines.\nThe beats were getting louder with every step. As he reached the base of the stones another instrument join the rhythm. The strange notes crawled up his skin and beckoned him to climb like running lights on an airstrip. The granite stones were too shaped to be natural he realized. They must be long forgotten stairs. Years of rain and sunshine had caused them to shift and sink, slowly entombing them in roots.\nThe inviting music could be resisted no longer. He began to climb the ancient staircase. The view that greeted him as he crested was that of a large clearing full of more granite chunks sticking out at odd angles from tall grass swaying in time with the music.\nThe music was emanating from the large stone structure at its center. Its melody was no longer muted by the trees and struck his body in waves. The harmonic undertow pulled him forward towards the center structure. The details of the structure became clearer as he neared. The center structure was the torso of a gigantic being intricately carve with geometric designs so worn by time they gave the being’s granite skin a wavy look. Its three arms were buried nearby up to their elbows. Stood before the immense towering torso, he felt inconsequential. The music pouring out of nine holes in its chest now set his hair on end at this distance. Awed, he took the pack off his sweaty back and sat cross legged before the giant.\nSuddenly, fierce light blazed from the holes, each a different color as the music swelled. New instruments joined the fray and a great rumbling in the ground beneath began to shake his very atoms. The chunks of granite he walked past began to pull themselves from the soft earth and float towards the torso. Each piece fit effortlessly into place without making a noise. Only the melody issuing from its chest could be heard.\nReassembled, the granite being slowly got to its feet. Its three arms broke the earth and pushed the giant to its feet. At its true height, the lights now flashed and spun, weaving their spotlights amongst the tall grass. And then, the giant being began to dance…\nEach footfall rattle the entire jungle to the beat. Its three arms wave through the air in long undulating motions as its torso rotated freely. It swayed with the grace of the long grass below it. Over and over again, its swaying brought its granite visage looming over him. It was if it was peering at a slow moving insect on the jungle floor.\nThe beats ceased and the melody began to slow the dramatic swaying of the granite being became lethargic. A chuck of its fore arm fell abruptly to the ground, followed by another from its knee. Soon giant chunks of granite rained from above him. The giant’s puppeteer was clipping its strings and the magic that held the being together receded with the music. The torso was the last to fall, gently lowering into the ground as the last beats faded. The glow of the nine holes dimmed and left him once again along in the clearing."

    "text": "After three days of rain, the clouds abated. The rain slicked road’s golden hue lay below a blanket of mist, undisturbed but for the occasional drop from the rooftops. The city’s streets were empty of traffic at 2am and quiet as a grave. Their footsteps echoed among the brick and concrete warehouses on either side. As they moved forward, the pavement sparkled under the incandescent light of the lamp light above. The whole street was aglow, paved in orange gold. The likes of which no king could dream. Only the shadow of their shadow revealed its true dull gray nature. Looking up at the streetlamps above them, they could see no stars behind the yellow clouds that still held the threat of rain. The lamps themselves were enshrined in misty halos. While the lamp’s diffused light safely painted the path before them, the buildings on either side of them were enshrouded in darkness. The lamp’s liquid gold could only go so far before being swallowed by alleyways and dark doorways. The intractable shadows made them nervous. Their mind populating the unknown with a thousand terrifying things lurking in the darkness. The thought kept them from the center of the road as they passed through the silent industrial tableau. The rusty machinery laying forgotten outside a factory cast grotesque shadows on its walls. The monstrous shape crawled across bricks as they walked as if they themselves were the source of light. They quickened their pace to put the eerie dance behind them. For the next few minutes, they kept their eyes on the radiant path before them, focusing on the magnificent shifting waves of golden streetlight before them. But it was not long before their eyes returned to gazing into the shadows in the gaps between buildings and behind dirty glass windows.\nThe old man was sitting so still the figure walking down the street almost missed him. It was not until his face turned to look as theirs that the man’s visage jumped into stark relief. The glow of the streetlamps deepened every crease in the man’s weathered face. The hair framing his face stuck to his skin unmoved by the earlier rain. His beard was wild, and his eyes pierced the night into their soul. His gaze drew the breath from their lungs. The intense look he gave spoke of a life hard lived. Of a hundred quiet indignities and a thousand loud ones. Of desperation, fear, and anger. His eyes searched the figure for something amorphous. Scouring every part of their body. The shadows drawn by lamplight held no secrets from him. The figure felt raw and naked beneath his stare, perpetually vulnerable. All of this was felt in an instance before the old man broke eye contact to adjust the blue tarp that covered him. Turning his shoulder into the eave protecting him, the fire in his eye faded. When he returned his eyes to the figure, they reflected the dull glow of the streetlights. The figure, suddenly free of their paralysis, started walking down the street, ever conscious of the weight of the old man’s eyes on their shoulders.\nLong after they turned the corner they shivered."

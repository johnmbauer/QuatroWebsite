    "text": "John Bauer, 2nd year ChE PhD student, Andrews Lab\n\n\nHello! My name is John Bauer and Iâ€™m interested in building interspecies genetic circuits to reprogram bacterial consortia for bioproduction and bioremediation. I earned my Bachelors of Science in chemical engineering at University of Wisconsin-Madison and recently became a PhD student in chemical engineering at University of Massachusetts-Amherst. I am currently working on establishing biosensors for heavy metals in Pseudomonas putida. In the future, I will incorporate these sensors into a bacterial consortia where each strain contains portions of an interspecies genetic circuit for the bioremediation of heavy metals."

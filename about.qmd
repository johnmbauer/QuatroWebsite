Hello! My name is John Bauer and I'm interested in building interspecies genetic circuits to reprogram bacterial consortia for bioproduction and bioremediation. I earned my Bachelors of Science in chemical engineering at University of Wisconsin-Madison and recently became a PhD student in the chemical engineering department of University of Massachusetts-Amherst. I am currently working on establishing biosensors for heavy metals in *Pseudomonas putida*. In the future, I will incorporate these sensors into a bacterial consortia where each strain contains portions of an interspecies genetic circuit for the bioremediation of heavy metals.
